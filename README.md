# This is me attempting to run on the code ignitor framework. I am also using a 3rd party API from mapquest. This should allow for a fully responsive, mobile first expereience. I am also attempting to use ajax to send the info over to my email controller from CI. There are a lot of moving parts here. At the beggining it was quiet challening but after looking over it more and more I was able to see how useful of a tool a framework could be. The stories page may not work becuase i was pulling from a database that my professor created via his server so it may not be working in the future.
