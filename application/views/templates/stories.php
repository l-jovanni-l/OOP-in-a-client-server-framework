Name: Jovanni Elias 
Final project 
Purpose: This is the template for my stories page. I am pulling out a 3D array. 
          The array contains news which have a title inside and under each title there is a story with it.
         This is a loop while not really being a loop. It loops on its own.

<div>    
{news}
<div class="storyTitle">
    {title}<br>
</div>

<div class="textIndent">
    {story}<br><br>
</div>


{/news}
</div>
